_NodeQuest_ is a video game with the following features:

- **Premise.** You control a samurai, unable to attack but has jumping skills, who must navigate through a poop filled platformer! The horror!

- **Design.** The team and I wanted to learn about `JavaScript` and `Node.js` while making a game.

- **Potential endeavors.** Much longer level with a working HUD and exciting controls.
